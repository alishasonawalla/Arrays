Respository Description
---

This repository contains programs that work with the array data structure. 
challenge1, challenge2, challenge3, challenge4 work with summation, average, first occurence, and number of occurences of elements in the array.

matrixWithoutOOP asks the user for number of rows and columns and then creates a 2D array. The program then offers the user a list of menu options for matrix operations. The user can add a column, reverse rows, transpose a matrix.

matrixWithOOP performs the same tasks as matrixWithoutOOP but using Object Oriented Programming. The program creates a matrix class with methods to add a column, reverse a row and transpose a matrix.
